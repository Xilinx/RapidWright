/**
 * Provide delay lookup for logic and intra site delay.
 *
 * Never construct DelayModel directly. Use DelayModelBuilder to guarantee that there is at most one DelayModel.
 *
 * Conventions:
 * A user see a cell with all its input and output pins. But, the user do NOT know
 * if a timing arc between each pair of input and output exists or not.
 * Thus, the user will call the delay model with each possible pair of input/output.
 * If the pair does not correspond to a timing arc, -1 will be returned.
 * the user have to interpret negative values as an indicator that the arc DOES NOT exist.
 *
 * The model is not context-aware. This means 1) a delay of an arc does not change with its load.
 * 2) there is an arc even when its input or output is not connected.
 * When the user see an input pin connected to VCC or GND, the user have to assume the
 * responsibility of replacing the delay with 0.
 *
 * TODO: change interaction with user to reduce runtime. In particular, a list of timing arcs will be
 * returned for the cell passed in by a user.
