RapidWright is an open source project from Xilinx Research Labs that
provides a new bridge to Vivado through reading and writing design
checkpoint (DCP) files.  Its mission is to enable power users greater
flexibility in customizing solutions to their unique implementation
challenges.

RapidWright also provides a new design methodology leveraging
pre-implemented modules (modules that have been synthesized, placed
and routed out-of-context).  These pre-implemented modules can be
cached, replicated and relocated using the RapidWright framework. We
see pre-implmented modules as a way to build systematic shells and
overlays and a core piece of strategy in achieving near-spec
performance.
